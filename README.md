# R Code: Random Forest

This code, writtin in the R programming language, is for Random Forest machine learning optimization and classification of a remotely sensed imagery stack. This code was implemented and associated with the Merchant et al. (2022) study, which used Random Forest to classify a time-series of Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) imagery (backscatter and coherence) for mapping Arctic hydro-ecological land cover conditions.
